# Bogus-Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

## 	<sub> Purpose: </sub> 
  A small project to visualize how some of these unconventional sorting algorithms work.

## 	<sub> Usage:	</sub>
  1. Download source files.
  2. Open the webpage using an IDE/extension of your choosing. (VSCode and Live Server were used in this project)
  3. Have fun learning about 3 terrible sorting algorithms that hopefully you will never use.

## 	<sub> Github Webpage:	</sub>
  Alternatively, you can go to https://waterproofwater.github.io/Bogus-Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/ to check out this project. There is no need to download anything.
